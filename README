1- INSTALL
    Run "installer" as root

2- START
    Run "receiver". You can choose a number of port.
    If no port number is given, it will use 1512 as default.

3- RULE
    SMART.log :
    [port_number] [time_stamp] @@ [data]

    "port_number" identifies the source of data. (Senders should use different port numbers.)
    "time_stamp" records the time of the data received.
    "data" contains the information we need for SMART.
